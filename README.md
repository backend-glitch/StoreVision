<h1 align="center">📦 Predictive Storage Planner</h1>

Predictive Storage Planner is an AI-powered storage management system that forecasts storage usage, predicts SSD health degradation, and provides intelligent optimization recommendations. It transforms storage from a passive system into a proactive, future-aware platform.

This project was designed for the SanDisk Hackathon.

## 🔥 Features
Storage Usage Monitoring
Real-time disk usage tracking (total, used, free) and file-type distribution.

SSD Health Prediction
Estimates SSD health based on write cycles, TBW, and simulated wear metrics.

Predictive Storage Forecasting
Forecasts storage exhaustion dates and SSD degradation timelines using regression/time-series analysis.

Smart Recommendations
Suggests preventive actions like:

Archiving old files to cold storage

Compressing media folders

Reducing log retention

Hybrid storage allocation

Interactive Dashboard
Clean UI showing usage trends, health graphs, forecasts, and recommend actions
